Imagine you have a bunch of pictures and you want to draw boxes around certain things in those pictures. 
Maybe you're trying to teach a computer to recognize those things in the future. 
Like, you might want to point out all the cats in your cat picture collection so that the computer can learn to find cats on its own.


Step 1 : Installing LabelImg

To do this, you need a special tool called "LabelImg". It's like a little helper that makes it easy to draw those boxes. 
First, you need to get LabelImg onto your computer. Think of this like downloading a new app on your phone. 
You open a little command window on your computer, and you type: 
pip install labelImg


Step 2 : Running LabelImg

Now, after you've installed LabelImg, you can just tell your computer to open it up. You do this by typing:
labelImg
It's like saying, "Hey computer, please open up LabelImg for me."
